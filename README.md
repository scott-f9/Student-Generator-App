# Student Roster Application

![GitHub Logo](https://i.imgur.com/4TPZmAS.png)

This application takes a list of student names, which are stored in a text file, and randomly generates a GPA, ID,
and student status associated with each student and saves this information in a csv file. The GUI application can 
then load this roster of students into the application and filter it to display a certain number of students or only
students with GPAs above a chosen value. This filtered list can then be saved to a new csv file.
